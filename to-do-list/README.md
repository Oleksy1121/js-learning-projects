# Simple To-Do List App

A simple web application to manage your daily tasks.

## Description

This project is a basic To-Do List application built using fundamental web technologies. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. The application also saves the tasks in the browser's local storage so they persist even after closing and reopening the application.
